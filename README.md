Note: In order to use this app, you'll need to use the Google API Console to register your SHA1 token along with the package name, this app won't work otherwise.

WatchTower is a simple application which was created to test and explore the functionality of the new [Proximity Beacon API](https://developers.google.com/beacons/proximity/guides). The application can be used to try out:

- Registering Beacons
- Updating Beacons
- Viewing Beacons
- Viewing Beacon Diagnostics
- Viewing Beacon Attachments
- Adding Beacon Attachments
- Deleting Single Beacon Attachments
- Deleting Batch Beacon Attachments by Type

Some features are not very practical within a mobile-app (for example, adding json data to attachments), so these have not been included.

Note: This was built *quickly* to simply test the APIs functionality. If you come across any bugs please feel free to submit them as an issue, or open a pull request ;)
